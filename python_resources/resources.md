# Python Data Science Resources

## Python distribution
Use Python 3 instead of Python 2, Python 2 is no longer supported as of January 2020.

I recommend using [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), which features a full suite of data science libraries.

## Libraries
The *must have* Python resources:
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is *the* package to use for data and linear algebra and is widely supported by other libraries.([Quickstart guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html))

* [Matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/) the standard for plotting in python. Can be used for line, bar, contour, and 3d plots (and more!) ([Tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html))

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) great tool for working with large sets of data. Good excel/csv input/output. Lots of indexing, slicing, grouping functionality

* [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) adds additional functionality to numpy, such as dimensions, coordinates, and attributes. My go-to for reading/writing netCDF4 and HDF5 data files.

## Beginners Guides
* [https://www.learnpython.org/](https://www.learnpython.org/) provides a good set of interactive tutorials
* [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) another good interactive guide, but uses python 2 instead of 3 (differences are minimal at this level)
* [https://github.com/karan/Projects-Solutions/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/karan/Projects-Solutions/blob/master/README.mdS) a list of good programming project ideas, along with sample code in various languages
