# Lucas' Code Blog
Welcome! My name is Lucas, and I'm a PhD student at UC Davis in the [cloud physics research group](https://adele.faculty.ucdavis.edu/). My main website can be [found here](https://lucassterzinger.com). 

I do a lot of data analysis work, mainly in Python, and I want to give back to the community and share coding tips and tricks that I've learned. 

I mainly use the [Colorado State RAMS model](https://vandenheever.atmos.colostate.edu/vdhpage/rams.php) for my research. To facilitate working with RAMS data in Python, I am working on a (very rough at the moment) library called [RAMSlibs](https://github.com/lsterzinger/ramslibs).
